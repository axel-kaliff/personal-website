# a summary about you
summary: 'My research interests center on exploring solutions to problems of scalability and reproducibility in real-world AI systems. I am particularly drawn to exploring how distributed systems and self-supervised continual learning principles can address fundamental challenges in AI and robotics. While my previous focus has been real-world robotics, I am passionate about distributed systems in general and am excited about its wide variety of applications.'
