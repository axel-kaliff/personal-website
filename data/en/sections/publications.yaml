- title: Can Visuo-motor Policies Benefit from Random Exploration Data? A Case Study on Stacking
  publishedIn:
    name: Arxiv Preprint
    date: 30 March 2025

  paper:
    summary: "Human demonstrations have been key to recent advancements in robotic manipulation, but their scalability is hampered by the substantial cost of the required human labor. In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-video sequences and actions produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-as an often overlooked resource for training visuo-motor policies in robotic manipulation. Towards this goal, we present a large-scale experimental study based on over 750 hours of robot data collection, comprising 400 successful and 12,000 failed episodes."

- title: "Simulation In The Loop: Real-Time Robot Action Success Verification with a Digital Twin"
  publishedIn:
    name: DIVA
    date: "July 2025"
    url: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1988006

  - name: Axel Kaliff
  paper:
    summary: This thesis investigates how robotic task execution can be improved by leveraging a digital twin to perform action success verification, in a paradigm referred to as Simulation-In-The-Loop (SIL) Specifically, this work focuses on using SIL for environment resetting, a process that returns a robotâ€“ environment system to a known initial state, which when implemented successfully supports continuous data collection and iterative learning. Using a digital twin constructed by the author of this thesis, SIL enables action validation through simulated perturbations prior to real-world deployment.

- title: "CloudGripper-AutoGrasper: A Cloud Robotics Toolkit for Automatic Data Collection"
  publishedIn:
    name: Workshop paper, unpublished. Presented at 2024 IEEE ICRA Conference.
    date: September 2024
  authors:
  - name: Axel Kaliff
  - name: Shutong Jin
  - name: Muhammad Zahid
  - name: Ruiyu Wang
  - name: Florian T Pokorny  
  paper:
    summary: "In this paper, we present Cloudgripper-Autograsper, a cloud robotics toolkit built on the CloudGripper open-source platform (https://cloudgripper.org), designed to optimize data collection with minimal human intervention. The toolkit features two main components: (1) automatic scene resetting via sequential pick-and-place operations for real-world data collection, and (2) fast transitions between simulated and real-world data through compatible API calls."

- title: "Assessment Accuracy of a Large Language Model on Programming Assignments"
  publishedIn:
    name: DIVA
    date: July 2023
    url: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1779792&dswid=4921

  paper:
    summary: "The education sector is changing rapidly and adopting new practices of managing student assignments. Manually assessing student work can be costly, as well as sometimes erroneous, implying it can be beneficial to automate the grading process. With new large language models rises questions on how well these can be used to grade assignments, as well as how their accuracy can be improved. This study has explored how task context affects the accuracy of a large language model when grading programming assignments."
